# FE UPDATE
- How to edit the table 
    -> turn into sth without a form (just edit in the table) and without a refresh
- page redirecting when the page no longer exist after deleting a row 
    - redirect back to home if nothing in month anymore (after delete)


# Migration
- migrate to sqlite
    - save the db file in environment folder
- [x] migrate the db input part (connect the functionalities to FE)
- Better sql -> not escaped currently
